# Introduction to Variables
This project introduces the student to variables in c as well as some loops.

## 0-positive\_or\_negative.c:  
A  program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and  print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

## 1-last\_digit.c:
A program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n based on some preset conditions.

## 2-print\_alphabet.c:
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

## 3-print\_alphabets.c:
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

## 4-print\_alphabt.c:
A program that prints the letters of the alphabet except e and q in lowercase.

## 5-print\_numbers.c:
A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

## 6-print\_numberz.c:
A program that prints all the single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 using a non-char variable and only the putchar function.

## 7-print\_tebahpla.c:
A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line using the putchar function.

## 8-print\_base16.c:
A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using the putchar function.

## 9-print\_comb.c:
A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by a comma and followed by a space using the putchar function.

## 100-print\_comb3.c:
A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits separated by a comma and followed by a space using the putchar function.

## 101-print\_comb4.c:
A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits separated by a comma and followed by a space using the putchar function.

## 102-print\_comb5.c:
A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers ranging from 0 to 99.
